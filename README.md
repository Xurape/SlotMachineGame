# Slot Machine Game
This is my first python's game I've ever made. It's a simple slot machine game using emojis. Simple, clean and intuitive code with a nice and clean "UI". It's one of the first python stuff I made, any tips are fully acceptable :)

# What's needed for it to work?
- Install the ``colorama`` package using PIP3 like this:
```
pip3 install colorama
```
